      <h1 className="text-center">Why mixing is difficult?</h1>

      <p>
        Frequency response that translates pretty much to every speaker system
        is not near the areas where people have the problems. Frequency spectrum
        is important, however is not the main root of the problems when mixing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Another issue associated with mixing is all the different listening
        environments. Every different environment will affect tonally,
        structurally. Some people have their houses full of furniture, others
        have only a little. Heavy curtains. All these factors will influence on
        the final mix.
      </p>

      <p>
        It's important to notice that every media has its limitations. However,
        what is difficult about mixing is that we have too many options, and we
        are trying to make a song sounds great in every single system.
