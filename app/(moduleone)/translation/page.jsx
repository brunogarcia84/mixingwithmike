      <h1 className="text-center">The Mixing Translation Guide</h1>

      <p>
        If we go through the frequency spectrum (20hz-20Khz), there's a range
        that seems to translate better into every system. Natuarlly, this
        becomes an important area to focus on when mixing. This area is,{" "}
        <span className="inlineDetail">but not limited to</span>, from 400Hz to
        6Khz.
      </p>

      <p>
        The above mentioned range is an area where every instrument needs to be
        well represented. In other words, the level within this range needs
        consistency in order for them to translate from system to system.
      </p>

      <p>
        The next thing to focus on is "Density Characteristics". Imagine that a
        speaker is basically a cone that is actually projecting or creating
        movements or fluctuations in air pressure. It is applied through a
        voltage. As this voltage changes, it is forcing the speaker to move
        forwards of backwards.
      </p>

      <p>
        The thing about dealing with density is not only how you deal with the
        area that has more energy, but how you deal with those frequencies
        surrounding the high-energy area.
      </p>

      <span>
        Density characteristics allow a certain instrument to image better in
        the speaker.
      </span>
      <span>
        Imaging an instrument is how clearly you can imagine something; you can
        close your eyes and you listen to it. It's almost like a visual aspect.
